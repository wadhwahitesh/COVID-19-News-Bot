# COVID-19-News-Bot

The newsbot.py file contains code which runs for getting the news and sending it to whatsapp.
There are several more functions added, such as focus mode in the busy() function, which controls your whatsapp when you are busy and tells everyone that you are busy. But due to whatsapp web being so laggy and full of bugs, this doesn't work as promisingly.
